**Build an AI-powered chatbot for Sparrow API Tool**
Develop an AI-powered chatbot for Sparrow, that enhances user experience by assisting
with backend development and REST API tool-related features. The chatbot should be
able to:
Engage users with a conversational interface that is intuitive and user-friendly.
Assist developers with backend development queries, providing best practices.
Any other cool feature that will be helpful to the developer community.
Provide documentation + video explaining the features developed.

            
**AI Dev-Boost Library**
Developers often face repetitive tasks in AI and machine learning projects, such as data
preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, model evaluation, and deployment.
These tasks can be time-consuming and error-prone if done from scratch each time. By
creating a library of well-documented AI-powered code snippets, we can streamline
these processes, allowing developers to focus on the more creative aspects of their
projects.
This library should not only include code snippets but also provide comprehensive
documentation and examples to facilitate easy integration and understanding, ensuring
that developers of all skill levels can benefit from the resource.
            

**AI-Powered API Documentation**
Develop AI-powered features for Sparrow that provide intelligent, context-aware API
documentation. The goal is to enhance the developer experience by simplifying
interaction with APIs and making documentation more accessible and useful.
Context-Aware API Documentation:
Develop an AI-powered documentation assistant that provides relevant API
documentation.
Enable the assistant to understand and respond to natural language questions about
API endpoints, parameters, and usage examples.
Ensure the documentation provided is detailed, accurate, and helps in
troubleshooting common issues.
Provide documentation explaining the features developed.
